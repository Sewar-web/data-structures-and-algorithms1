# Trees
* Tree => Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. It is a non-linear data structure. It has the following properties âˆ’

    - One node is marked as Root node.

    - Every node other than the root is associated with one parent node.

    - Each node can have an arbiatry number of chid node.


**the tree have 3 type of insertions**

1. pre_order => from root then left then right 
2. in order => from left then root then right 
3. poet_order => from right then left then root 

## Challenge
1. create three type of tree
2. creat BST and add values depend on tree methodology
3. and add method to search if the value in the tree or not 


## Approach & Efficiency

i used approach regression

## API

in cc15 i write 3 class one for node and second for tree 
and inside tree we define 3 method and this methos is type of tree and how insertion 
1. pre_order => from root then left then right 
2. in order => from left then root then right 
3. poet_order => from right then left then root 

and the last class is BST is inhetr from tree 
and i write to methos one to add in tree in right way like from root and if lessthan root go insert in left node other wise go in right node and the same methodology for method Contains but this method return true or false if the value in tree or not
